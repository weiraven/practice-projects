# practice-projects

mongoDB-file-storage project began as a practice implementation of @TraversyMedia's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f5Q9wDePzY however the video is nearly 6 years old and multer-gridfs does not appear to be a supported package for newer versions of MongoDB, so I've adapted the project to utilize MongoDB's natively supported GridFS tool as well as adding on additional endpoints and features for viewing and downloading files

sample-vite-website project is a practice implementation of @GreatStackDev's video https://youtu.be/aKByHmd6unc?si=eOSg-sluyVhDDBzY only replaced car assets with pictures of my cat
