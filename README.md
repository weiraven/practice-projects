# practice-projects

mongoDB-file-storage project began as a practice implementation of @TraversyMedia's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f5Q9wDePzY however the video is nearly 6 years old and multer-gridfs does not appear to be a supported package for newer versions of MongoDB, so the project has been adapted to use MongoDB's natively supported GridFS tool

sample-vite-website project is a practice implementation of @GreatStackDev's video https://youtu.be/aKByHmd6unc?si=eOSg-sluyVhDDBzY
